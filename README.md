This program is designed for detecting edges in images using the sobel technique. This method is also used for convolutional neural
networks.

# Program Details
- Made with Python
- Uses only the standard math library and the PIL image processing library to manipulate pixel values
- Includes greyscale options and Gaussian blurring
